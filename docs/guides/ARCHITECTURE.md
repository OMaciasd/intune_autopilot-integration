  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Checkout') {
              steps {
                  checkout scm
              }
          }
          stage('Build') {
              steps {
                  script {
                      sh 'mvn clean install'
                  }
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy to Intune') {
              steps {
                  script {
                      // Integrate Jenkins with Intune for deployment
                      sh './deploy-to-intune.sh'
                  }
              }
          }
          stage('Verify Device Compliance') {
              steps {
                  script {
                      // Check device compliance with Intune before app deployment
                      sh './check-device-compliance.sh'
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }

  ```

## 🔐 DevSecOps Best Practices

DevSecOps integrates security practices into every phase of the development lifecycle, ensuring that **Intune**-managed mobile devices remain secure and compliant during app deployments. By embedding security into the CI/CD pipeline, this approach ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated early, preventing issues from reaching production.

### 🛡️ Key Practices

#### 1. 🔍 Automated Security Testing

Integrate security tools such as **OWASP ZAP**, **SonarQube**, or **Trivy** into the Jenkins pipeline to perform security scans on both application code and mobile app packages before deployment to **Intune**. This ensures that only secure code and app packages are deployed, minimizing vulnerabilities that could affect device security.

Example Jenkins Pipeline integration with OWASP ZAP:

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Security Test') {
              steps {
                  script {
                      sh 'zap-cli quick-scan --self-contained --url http://your-app-url.com'
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }

  ```

This automated security testing step helps identify potential security flaws and ensures that applications meet security compliance before being deployed to Intune-managed devices.

By incorporating security testing into the pipeline, developers can address vulnerabilities before deployment, ensuring only secure and compliant code and app packages reach **Intune** devices.

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use **Terraform**, **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** templates, and **PowerShell** scripts to define and manage **Intune** policies, device configurations, and infrastructure as code. This approach enables consistent, automated security configurations, ensuring all devices are securely configured before deployment.

With **IaC**, you can ensure that the security configurations for **Intune** devices are maintained consistently across environments, reducing human error and configuration drift. This approach allows for automated updates, modifications, and enforcement of security policies across a fleet of devices.

---

### PowerShell for Intune Configuration

You can use **PowerShell** scripts to configure and automate **Intune** device policies, app deployments, and compliance checks. This is particularly useful for managing large-scale deployments and ensuring that security policies are always applied correctly.

Using **PowerShell**, you can automate various tasks such as:

- Configuring device compliance policies
- Deploying apps and updates to **Intune**-managed devices
- Performing regular compliance checks to ensure devices meet security standards

#### Example PowerShell script to configure an Intune device policy

  ```powershell
  # Example: PowerShell script to configure Intune device policy
  $intuneConnection = Connect-MSGraph # Connect to Microsoft Graph for Intune
  Set-IntuneDeviceCompliancePolicy -PolicyName "DevicePolicy" -Platform "Android" -MaxOSVersion "10.0" -EncryptionRequired $true

  ```

This script connects to Microsoft Graph to apply a compliance policy for Intune-managed Android devices. The policy ensures that devices are running a minimum OS version and have encryption enabled, helping to enforce security standards across all managed devices.
