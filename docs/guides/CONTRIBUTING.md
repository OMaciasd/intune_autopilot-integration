# 🛠️ How to Contribute

We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project! Here are the steps you need to follow to get started:

---

## 🍽️ 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. Then, clone the repository to your local machine to begin working on your contribution.

1. Clone your fork to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory

---

## 🌱 2. Create a Branch

It's important to create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix. This helps in keeping the **main** branch clean and makes it easier to manage different changes.

To create and switch to a new branch, run:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-name

  ```

Replace feature-name with a descriptive name for your branch. For example, if you're working on adding a new login feature, you might name the branch add-login-feature.

By creating separate branches for each task, you'll be able to work on multiple features or fixes independently, and it will be easier to merge them later.

---

## 3. ✏️ Make Your Changes

Now you can start working on your changes. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, make sure your code follows the project's conventions.

- Write clean, readable code and follow the **style guide**.
- Ensure that your changes are well-tested and documented.

---

## 4. 💾 Commit Your Changes

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive commit message:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Describe the change or feature"

  ```

Make sure your commit messages are clear and describe the purpose of the changes.

---

## 5. 🚀 Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature-name

  ```

This will upload your changes to your remote fork, ready for review.

---

## 6. 🔄 Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once your branch is pushed, go to the original repository and create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository. The PR should:

- Be against the **main** branch of the repository.
- Include a clear description of what changes you've made and why.
- Reference any issues that the PR addresses.

Once your PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main project.

---

## 7. 📝 Address Review Feedback

Project maintainers may suggest or require changes before your PR is merged. Please address any feedback promptly and push the necessary changes back to your branch.
