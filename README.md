## 🛠️ Configuration Instructions

### Security Policy Setup

1. **Access the Microsoft Intune portal:**
   - Go to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
   - Navigate to **Devices > Configuration profiles**.

2. **Create a new configuration profile:**
   - Choose the device type (Windows, iOS, Android).
   - Configure security policies (passwords, disk encryption, malware protection, etc.).

3. **Apply policies:**
   - Select the user or device groups to which you want to apply the policy.

4. **Review Policies:**
   - Review the policies applied and ensure they are active on all devices.

---

### Application Setup in Intune

1. **Add apps to Intune:**
   - Go to **Apps > All Apps > Add**.
   - Choose the app type (Win32, Android, iOS, etc.).

2. **Configure app distribution:**
   - Define necessary configurations (auto-updates, permissions, etc.).
   - Assign apps to user or device groups.

3. **App Policies:**
   - Apply additional policies to control app installation, execution, or removal.

## 📦 Integration with Other Services

Integration with **Azure Active Directory** allows identity management, while other security and management tools like **Microsoft Defender** or **Azure Security Center** can be integrated to strengthen security policies.

---

## 📈 Benefits

- **Improved Security**: Apply security policies at the device level to protect sensitive data.
- **Automation**: Remote and automated management of devices and applications, saving time and effort.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with corporate and legal standards related to data protection.
